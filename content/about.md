Twenty years of experience as a system administrator in heterogeneous networks, integrating Linux, various flavours of BSD and &ndash; occasionally &ndash; Windows.

Working at various companies developing software, I was responsible for [CI][wp:ci] and service transition. During that time, I noticed the need to understand developers better and started to learn programming beyond the needs of a system administrator, becoming a DevOps person coming from the other side -- an OpsDev, if you will.
