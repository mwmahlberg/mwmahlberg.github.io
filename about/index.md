## About this Site

This blog will have posts about my interest, both work and personal related. So, expect a mixture of technical posts, as well as cooking recipes and everything that catches my attention.

The original reason why I set up this blog is that I seem to answer the same questions on [StackOverflow][so] over and over again. While StackOverflow and the [other sites of the StackExchange network][se:sites] are awesome, their format makes it hard to answer questions which are not bad by nature, but require long and detailed answers.
